Finding the right architecture when applying a neural network to some classification problem is an expensive and time consuming endeavor. In this repository we use MPI4PY 
(a python library for using MPI) to parallelize the testing of various neural network architectures. 


Description of the code base:
1. digits_MPI.py base code that holds the parallel neural network 
2. TorchBaseline.ipynb python notebook that holds the base code for the Torch neural network
3.
